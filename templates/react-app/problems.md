## Why?

Recording problems and snags encountered during development enables the following:

1. During development, another developer in the team could have independent solutions to problems; these can be applied as problems are added to this document.
2. After development, someone responsible for DX in the frontend team can apply improvements to tools / processes to anticipate the same problems in future projects.
3. Problems across several projects can be collected into a learning resource for new/existing developers.

## Format
